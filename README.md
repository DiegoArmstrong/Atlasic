# The Problem

Have you ever been overwhelmed while trying to keep track of all the ***relevant dependencies*** of a codebase? **Us too**... 

Whether you're:

- building your first feature at a new job
- figuring out what parts of the architecture need optimization/refactoring
- documenting and communicating changes

... it can take way longer than it should. The problem **is not** that you're too slow of a learner or expected to know an entire codebase like the back of your hand. 

Humans are primarily **VISUAL** thinkers and learners, but code and documentation is all just a bunch of non-stimulating text!

# The Solution

This is where Atlasic comes in...

Atlasic is ***an atlas for your logic***. 

We take your codebase's logic and give you back an interactive atlas of the relationships that matter, so you can navigate the structure of the system faster. This way, you can spend more of your time building solutions instead of figuring out where to start.

# Usage

Atlasic is a published [VsCode Extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=atlasic.atlasic)!

Have fun seeing your codebase like never before!
